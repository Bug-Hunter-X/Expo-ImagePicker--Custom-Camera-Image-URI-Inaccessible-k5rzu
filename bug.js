This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library in conjunction with a custom camera implementation.  The issue manifests as the inability to access the captured image data after the user takes a photo using the custom camera. The image picker returns a seemingly valid response, but the image URI is inaccessible. This usually happens when there is a mismatch in the way the image is handled between the custom camera and the Expo ImagePicker library's processing.

```javascript
// buggy code
const pickImage = async () => {
  let result = await ImagePicker.launchCameraAsync({
    mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images,
    allowsEditing: true,
    aspect: [4, 3],
  });

  console.log(result); // result might be seemingly valid but uri is invalid
  if (!result.cancelled) {
    // this might throw an error or just return null
    console.log(result.uri);
  }
};
```
